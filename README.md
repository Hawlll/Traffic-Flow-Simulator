# Traffic-Flow-Simulator

### Description
This project simulates traffic flow on a grid-based road network using Pygame. Cars are spawned on designated roads and move according to their speed limits and following distances. Stop signs and intersections are implemented to manage traffic flow and detect collisions.

### Features
  * Grid-based road network
  * Spawning cars on designated roads
  * Cars moving with speed limits and following distances
  * Stop signs to control traffic flow
  * Intersections to manage traffic flow
  * Collision detection between cars
  * Crash sound effect (optional, requires a sound file)
  * Pausing the simulation with the 'p' key
